## This repository serves as a record of all of the assignments, challenges, and assessments that I have completed during my time studying at Fullstack Academy.
## Fullstack Academy in partnership with the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline / SBS offers qualified candidates an opportunity to study tuition-free.
## Over the course of approximately 4 months, participants study advanced Microsoft Excel, SQL, Git, Unix, Python, Tableau, and AWS cloud.
## Out of 400+ candidates, I was 1 of 30 selected to participate in this bootcamp experience.
## My goal is to use my past experience plus the skills acquired through Fullstack to contribute to a company as a data/business analyst, project manager, or product owner. My past experience is in business, language, analytics, and corporate training.
